evaluation metrics
1.accuracy
2.confusion matrix
3.Area Under Curve


Accuracy:
acc=No.of correct predictions/Total No.of predictions

Confusion Matrix:

							Error			Error-free
Predicted as error			 x					y
Predicted as error-free		 z					w	


error misclassification = (y)/(x+y)
error-free misclassification = (z)/(z+w)
overall accuracy = (x+y)/(x+y+z+w)

Area under curve:
graph with x axis as false positive rate and y axis as true positive rate
